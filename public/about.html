      <h1>Welcome to 3Squared</h1>
<p>We are 3Squared! Make.Change.Work. Digital innovation in rail is nothing new. But success has often been tactical, partial, temporary or not at all. So it’s not surprising that some stakeholders are difficult to bring on-side.</p>
<p>That’s why forward-thinkers need more than just sharp technology. They need partners who are implementation experts, proven to win over sceptical stakeholders and deliver results in the real world of rail.</p>
<p>And they need point solutions designed to grow into larger business answers.</p>
<p>3Squared is the partner who has it all. The ethic, capacity, portfolio and roadmap to deliver success every step of the way.</p>
<p>That’s why we say only 3Squared is truly in the business of client success, and not just software. That’s the 3Squared difference.</p>
<h2>Let’s Make.Change.Work.Together.</h2>
